      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine standing in a courtroom. You are the innocent defendant in a trial, being prosecuted for a terrible crime. The jury comes out and gives their verdict - your body goes numb. Guilty. You&amp;rsquo;re given a death sentence for a crime you didn&amp;rsquo;t commit. It&amp;rsquo;s a mind-boggling situation. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/exonerations_us_1989_2012_full_report.pdf&#34;&gt;But it happens&lt;/a&gt;. We know it happens because we find people being exonerated from death sentences in light of new evidence, being released after half a lifetime in prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hope is that this is a rare occurrence. But how often &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; it happen? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

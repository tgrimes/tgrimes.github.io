Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate at the Univeristy of Florida. My research interests include the development of statistical methodology for -omics data.

Recent work has focused on RNA-seq data (transcriptomics), with methods in the areas of survival analysis, predictive modelling, and graphical models. How might gene expression profiles be used to predict patient survival times? How do gene-gene associations differ in high-risk vs. low-risk patients, and what clues do these differences leave us about the underlying disease? Future work will delve into methodology for single-cell data, which provides a much finer resolution of cellular activity.

I prefer assessing model performance through extensive simulations over large-sample inference; the latter can be reassuring, but the former forces us to better understand the biological context (or data generating process) to which the methods are applied. Through simulations we can explore conditions to find when our models work and when they fail - this is a process that has often lead me to new insights and a deeper understanding.

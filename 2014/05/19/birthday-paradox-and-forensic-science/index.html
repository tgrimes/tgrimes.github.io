      <article role="main" class="blog-post">
        <p>This post is derived from an interesting <a href="http://lpr.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/1/3.full">paper</a> found in <a href="http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/lawprj/about.html">Law, Probability, and Risk</a>. The <a href="http://scientopia.org/blogs/goodmath/2013/11/18/the-birthday-paradox/">birthday paradox</a>, which comes up in probability theory, is used in the paper. The paradox goes something like this: Imagine you&rsquo;re in a classroom with 30 students, and you are asked how likely it is that any two of those students will have the same birthday (same month and day). Intuitively, it seems fairly unlikely to find two such students. After all, it&rsquo;s uncommon that you as an individual will run into someone with your same birthday. But as it turns out&hellip; </p>

<p>If you have a room of 30 students, about 70% of the time there will be two students with the same birthday. (The reasoning leading to this conclusion is presented in the paper, and there are many other <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-birthday-paradox/">more detailed explanations</a> of the paradox.) This is a surprising result that highlights how unintuitive probability can be.</p>

<p>Now what does this have to do with forensic science? Well, very little. But similar reasoning used to resolve the birthday paradox is used again later on (and the paper plays on this role to a much greater extent).</p>

<p>On the forensic science front, the big idea at play is the supposed law that <em>patterns arising in nature are uniquely identifiable</em>. For instance,the 3D pattern of a human fingerprint, or the impressions left on a bullet fired by a particular gun, are each unique. This fact is fine and is not what&rsquo;s being challenged. In application, however, the complexity of the problem rises. Not only is each source unique, but each instance created by the source is also unique. For example, two fingerprints left by the same finger will not be entirely identical. (They won&rsquo;t look exactly like each other, nor will they look exactly like the source.) The pressure applied by the finger, along with other variables, will have an influence on the print. And similarly, two bullets fired by the same gun will also have unique impressions left on them. From the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Uniqueness does not guarantee that prints from two different people are always sufficiently different that they cannot be confused, or that two impressions made by the same finger will also be sufficiently similar to be discerned as coming from the same source.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The proposition in forensic science, which the paper refers to as the <strong>law of nature</strong>, suggests that the unique instances will not lead to contradictory conclusions. That is, a full fingerprint found at a crime scene will not correspond to more than one source. (It will correspond to only one person.) This leads to the conclusion that if a fingerprint is &ldquo;matched&rdquo; to a particular person, it can be presented in a trial as a certainty. (There&rsquo;s zero chance that it could match to any other person.) Part of the evidence for this proposition, the law of nature, lies heavily on the fact that contradictory conclusions have not yet been encountered.</p>

<p>Take the following example: In a forensics case, a bullet is found at a crime scene. The investigators have 20 different guns that they test. The law of nature basically says that the imprint on the bullet will match to at most one gun (if any). So if a match is found with one of these twenty guns, we can say that the bullet was fired from that gun, and no other gun. Over the past few decades, there has yet to be a forensics case where a bullet has matched to more than one gun being investigated; this is part of the evidence in support for the law of nature.</p>

<p>Here is where the birthday paradox comes into play. Basically, if the law of nature is true, then we will never find a case where a bullet would match to two guns; but even if the law of nature were false, it would still be very unlikely to find such a case. (This can be concluded through similar reasoning as the birthday paradox.) Thus the &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; in support of the law is not very substantial, because in either case we would find the same evidence.</p>

<p>But this is not all to say that the assumed law of nature is invalid. In fact it is most likely true (and even if it were false, the implications on its application would not change by much).</p>

<p>What it does mean, however, is that the implied &ldquo;certainty&rdquo; presented in a trial should be replaced with a &ldquo;most likely&rdquo;. Forensics experts can testify that the bullet&rsquo;s impressions correspond to that given by the defendant&rsquo;s gun, <em>but it could also correspond to that of another gun, one which we haven&rsquo;t tested, although the probability of this happening extremely small</em>. Commonly what happens is that the forensic evidence is given, but its inherit probability is not acknowledged. The key point is that a level of uncertainty does exist, and it should be presented accurately to the jury, so that they can weigh that piece of evidence appropriately.</p>

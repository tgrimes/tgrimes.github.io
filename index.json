Exposing network irregularities offers an avenue for discovery in systems biology; these pursuits can include the study of gene function in developmental biology and understanding and treating diseases. Modern methods for differential network analysis often have two drawbacks: they implicitly rely on the selection of a relatively small subset of genes before analysis, and they are not flexible to the choice of association measure.\n **Methods:** A general framework for integrating known gene regulatory pathways into a differential network analysis is proposed. The framework allows for any gene-gene association measure to be used, and inference is carried out through permutation testing. A simulation study investigates the performance in identifying differentially connected genes when incorporating known pathways and compares the general framework to four state-of- the-art methods. Two RNA-seq datasets are analyzed to illustrate the use of this framework in practice. \n **Results:** The simulation study shows that incorporating pathway information can improve performance in terms of both sensitivity and true discovery rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the state-of-the-art methods each estimate different things and are not directly comparable – this emphasizes the fact that the choice of association measure can have a strong influence on results. In the applied examples, the analysis reveals genes and pathways that are known to be biologically significant along with new findings to motivate future research. \n **Conclusions:** The proposed framework makes explicit two critical, but often overlooked, assumptions: the selection of a subset of genes and the meaning of gene-gene association. The results obtained from analyzing gene expression with this framework are more interpretable, and the pathway information provides context that can lead to deeper insights.","tags":["Gene regulatory networks","RNA-seq","Permutation testing"],"title":"Integrating gene regulatory pathways into differential network analysis of gene expression data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536465600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Tyler Grimes"],"categories":null,"content":"   Q\u0026amp;A starts at 16:20\n","date":1531074000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531074000,"objectID":"0c140fe53cf9bc322733da3d37e08f57","permalink":"/talk/ismb_2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-08T14:20:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ismb_2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Gene expression profiles from RNA-sequencing provide a window to the activity inside tumor cells. This view has enabled researchers to identify driver genes for the pathology, but often these results fail to validate or only hold for the particular cancer at hand. In this study, we investigate a robust method for identifying cancer-related genes. Two criteria are used: a gene must show functional changes among clinically different groups of patients, and the gene must have clinical relevance. These conditions are assessed through a differential network analysis and by modelling patient survival times. Preliminary results are shown from a neuroblastoma and breast cancer dataset.","tags":[],"title":"An exploratory approach for identifying cancer driver genes from gene expression data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Tyler Grimes","Alejandro R.

Accurate prognosis has remained a challenge for many patients. In this study, expression profiles from RNA-sequencing are used to predict survival times directly. Several models are investigated using various annotation levels of expression profiles (genes, transcripts, and introns), and an ensemble predictor is proposed as a heuristic for combining these different profiles. \n **Results:** The use of RNA-seq data is shown to improve accuracy in comparison to using clinical data alone for predicting overall survival times. Furthermore, clinically high-risk patients can be subclassified based on their predicted overall survival times. In this effort, the best performing model was the elastic net using both transcripts and introns together. This model separated patients into two groups with 2-year overall survival rates of 0.40±0.11 (n=22) versus 0.80±0.05 (n=68). The ensemble approach gave similar results, with groups 0.42±0.10 (n=25) versus 0.82±0.05 (n=65). This suggests that the ensemble is able to effectively combine the individual RNA-seq datasets. \n **Conclusions:** Using predicted survival times based on RNA-seq data can provide improved prognosis by subclassifying clinically high-risk neuroblastoma patients.","tags":["Survival analysis","RNA-seq","Sparse estimation"],"title":"Predicting survival times for neuroblastoma patients using RNA-seq expression profiles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alejandro R.

As part of the 2017 CAMDA MetaSUB Inter-City Challenge, next generation sequencing (NGS) data was generated from swipe samples collected from subway stations in Boston, New York City hereafter New York, and Sacramento. DNA was extracted and Illumina sequenced. Sequencing data was provided for all cities as part of 2017 CAMDA contest challenge dataset. **Results:** Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clear clustering of the samples for the three cities, with a substantial proportion of the variance explained by the first three components. We ran two different classifiers and results were robust for error rate (95%). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that overall, bacterial composition across the three cities is significantly different. A similar conclusion was reached using a novel bootstrap based test using diversity indices. Last but not least, a co-abundance association network analyses for the taxonomic levels “order”, “family”, and “genus” found different patterns of bacterial networks for the three cities. **Conclusions:** Bacterial fingerprint can be useful to predict sample provenance. In this work prediction of provenance reported with over 95% accuracy. Association based network analysis, emphasized similarities between the closest cities sharing common bacterial composition. ANOVA showed different patterns of bacterial amongst cities, and these findings strongly suggest that bacterial signature across multiple cities are different. This work advocates a data analysis pipeline which could be followed in order to get biological insight from this data. However, the biological conclusions from this analysis is just an early indication out of a pilot microbiome data provided to us through CAMDA 2017 challenge and will be subject to change as we get more complete data sets in the near future. This microbiome data can have potential applications in forensics, ecology, and other sciences.","tags":[],"title":"Unraveling bacterial fingerprints of city subways from microbiome 16S gene profiles","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I’m a Ph.D. Candidate at the Univeristy of Florida.

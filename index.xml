      <description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose you come across a news headline &amp;ldquo;FDA study links MMR vaccines to Autism&amp;rdquo;. An excerpt from the article reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After analyzing data from U.S. medical records from 2001-2014, a recent study by the FDA finds a strong link between MMR vaccination and Autism diagnoses. These results support the long-standing claim by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.voicesforvaccines.org/leaving-the-anti-vaccine-movement/&#34;&gt;anti-vaxxer&lt;/a&gt; movement, that receiving vaccines can increase a child&amp;rsquo;s likelihood of developing Autism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading this, one big question should pop up: is this conclusion appropriate? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>False conviction rates for death sentences</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine standing in a courtroom. You are the innocent defendant in a trial, being prosecuted for a terrible crime. The jury comes out and gives their verdict - your body goes numb. Guilty. You&amp;rsquo;re given a death sentence for a crime you didn&amp;rsquo;t commit. It&amp;rsquo;s a mind-boggling situation. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/exonerations_us_1989_2012_full_report.pdf&#34;&gt;But it happens&lt;/a&gt;. We know it happens because we find people being exonerated from death sentences in light of new evidence, being released after half a lifetime in prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hope is that this is a rare occurrence. But how often &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; it happen? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Birthday Paradox and Forensic Science</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is derived from an interesting &lt;a href=&#34;http://lpr.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/1/3.full&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/lawprj/about.html&#34;&gt;Law, Probability, and Risk&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://scientopia.org/blogs/goodmath/2013/11/18/the-birthday-paradox/&#34;&gt;birthday paradox&lt;/a&gt;, which comes up in probability theory, is used in the paper. The paradox goes something like this: imagine you&amp;rsquo;re in a classroom with 30 students and you want to know how likely it is that any two of those students will have the same birthday (same month and day). Intuitively, it seems fairly unlikely to find two such students. After all, it&amp;rsquo;s uncommon that you as an individual will run into someone with your same birthday. But as it turns out&amp;hellip; &lt;/p&gt;</description>
